# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition

Convolutional Neural Network trained on 60000 images of handwritten digits
## Installation setup

  - install the following libraries for training purposes
    - numpy
    - keras
    - matplotlib
    - sklearn
    
  - install the following libraries for testing the model
    - tkinter
    - keras
    - CV2
    - numpy
    - PIL
    
  - Open ``handwritten_digits1.ipynb`` in Jupyter notebook or Google colab
  - execute all the cells consecutively to train the model
  - model will be saved at the end with name 'digitdemo1.h5'
  - run ``scatchboard.py`` to test the model by drawing some digits on canvas
